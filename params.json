I have been a geek my entire life and actually began college studying to become an Astronautical Engineer. That is when I began working with a few start-ups and learned a lot from great developers. I found this to be the perfect career for the skills I have. After gaining some experience, I am now ready to start my journey in this technology driven world which I have become so passionate about. I am currently working as a software development engineer intern at a tech start-up in Seattle, but am always looking for new projects to work on!
